          <h1>Here Are a Few of My Research Papers</h1>
          <ol>
              <li><a href="homecourt.pdf" target="_blank">Homecourt Advantage in the NBA</a></li>
              <p>If one has no knowledge of the NBA and must bet
                  between two teams playing a game against each other, which team should that person choose?
                  The home team is the better choice. Previous literature has found that overall, home teams win
                  more games than road teams in the NBA. However, do certain teams benefit more from
                  homecourt advantage than others? In particular, how does homecourt advantage in the NBA
                  differ per team depending on each team’s overall strength? This study hypothesizes that average
                  teams benefit more from homecourt advantage than below average and above average teams.
                  However, the results of this study found that a team’s overall strength does not significantly
                  impact how much it benefits from homecourt advantage. The effect of homecourt advantage was
                  found to be relatively the same in below average, average, and above average teams.</p>

              <li><a href="nba_mlb_betting.pdf" target="_blank">Predictability of NBA and MLB Games</a></li>
              <p>With Charlie Blampied and Chloe Zhao</p>
              <p>In this paper, I analyzed betting data for NBA and MLB games in 2019 and 2020 to see how well bookmakers predicted the results of the games.</p>

              <li><a href="substitution.pdf" target="_blank">Substitution Theory in the NBA</a></li>
              <p>Ever noticed that higher-paid NBA players generally receive more technical fouls?
                In this paper, I tested the hypothesis that higher-paid players misbehave more often on the court because they think that they cannot be replaced.</p>
              <li><a href="superstar.pdf" target="_blank">The Superstar Effect in the NBA</a></li>
              <p>With Arielle Ambra-Juarez and Toshihiko Mori</p>
              <p>In this paper, we seek to examine how many additional fans, on average, the presence of an
                  NBA star attracts to home and away games, using data from the 2014-2015 to the 2018-2019
                  regular seasons. We classify an NBA star into two different categories: players voted to be an
                  All-Star starter and players voted to be an All-Star reserve (i.e. bench player). While we do not
                  find large effects overall, we find that the effects of NBA All-Star starters are much greater than
                  that for reserves. We also found greater effects for All-Star starters at home games, as opposed
                  to away games, which ran contrary to our initial hypothesis. We also analyze the effect of the
                  last five players to win a regular season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award: James Harden,
                  Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James. Although our overall
                  analysis fails to find large effects, we find that one player has a very strong superstar effect for
                  both home and away games: LeBron James.</p>
